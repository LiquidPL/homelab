        Please go to https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/keys and generate a reusable
        auth key, which is going to be used to provision Tailscale on the virtual machines.
        For security, it is recommended to set the expiry date to one day, and optionally
        revoke the key after running this playbook.

        Enter the tailscale auth key
